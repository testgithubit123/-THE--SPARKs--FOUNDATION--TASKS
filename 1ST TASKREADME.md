# Supervised ML Prediction - Sparks Foundation Task 1
This repository contains the solution for Task 1 of the Sparks Foundation Internship Program. The task involves performing a supervised machine learning (ML) prediction using linear regression.

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a linear regression model that predicts the percentage of marks a student is expected to score based on the number of hours they studied. The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of two variables: "Hours" (number of hours studied) and "Scores" (percentage of marks obtained).

# The main objective is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the percentage of marks a student would score based on the number of hours they studied.

# Requirements
To run the code and replicate the results, the following dependencies are required:

# Python 3.x
# Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
# The necessary Python libraries can be installed using the following command:

 
 . pip install -r requirements.txt
 # Dataset
The dataset used for this project is provided as a CSV file named student_scores.csv. It contains two columns: "Hours" and "Scores". The "Hours" column represents the number of hours studied by a student, and the "Scores" column represents the corresponding percentage of marks obtained by the student.


# Results
The project demonstrates the following steps:

1.Data exploration and visualization.
2.Data preprocessing and splitting into training and testing sets.
3.Model training using linear regression.
4.Model evaluation using mean squared error and coefficient of determination (R-squared).
5.Prediction of scores for a given number of study hours.
6.Visualization of the regression line.
# The final trained model achieves a good fit and can be used to predict the percentage of marks a student is likely to score based on the number of hours they studied.
